**Reproducibility Task**

*Objective:*
Generate code to reproduce the tables listed below. *Do not* simply copy paper results.

*Tables to Reproduce:*
{tables_to_reproduce}

*Inputs:*
- The social science research paper pdf as 'paper.pdf'.

*Instructions:*
1. Write a script that preprocesses data, if necessary, and produces any intermediate datasets required.
2. Write all necessary scripts for reproducing table results.
3. Write a script that formats and saves each reproduced table in Markdown format. The script should save each reproduced table as its own individual Markdown file containing *only* the Markdown table and a notes section as a separate Markdown paragraph below the table, if necessary. *Do not* include any extra text. Name the Markdown file after the table it contains. For example, the file containing {ex_table} should be named '{ex_table}.md'.
4. Write a bash script that installs all necessary requirements, makes all necessary directories, and runs the generated scripts for reproducing each table.

*Important:*
- Do not copy results from the paper.
- All code must be runnable from start to finish.
- Create and maintain a text file named 'output.txt' that documents your thinking during reproduction. Note any assumptions made during reproduction.

*Output Requirements:*
- Each script should be saved in the following format: 
<file="file_path"> 
    file contents 
</file>
- Save 'output.txt' in the following format:
<file="output.txt"> 
    file contents 
</file>
