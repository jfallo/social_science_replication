**Reproducibility Task**

*Objective:*
Reproduce the tables listed below using the methodology in the paper pdf and the provided raw data. *Do not* simply copy paper results.

*Tables to Reproduce:*
{tables_to_reproduce}

*Instructions:*
1. Write a Python script for preprocessing, if necessary, that:
    1. Loads any datasets required for reproduction from the provided data files.
    2. Performs all necessary preprocessing steps (cleaning, formatting, handling missing values, type conversions, etc.).
    3. Generates all required intermediate datasets.
    4. Saves each intermediate dataset as a .csv file.
2. Write all necessary Python scripts for reproducing table results that:
    1. Load the required input data.
    2. Perform all necessary analyses and calculations.
    3. Generate the tables to reproduce, formatted exactly as they appear in the paper.
    4. Save each reproduced table in Markdown format as its own individual Markdown file containing *only* the Markdown table and a notes section as a separate Markdown paragraph below the table, if necessary. *Do not* include any extra text. Name the Markdown file after the table it contains. For example, the file containing {ex_table} should be named '{ex_table}.md'.
    5. Include comments documenting your methodology.
3. Write a bash script that:
    1. Creates a python virtual environment in the current directory.
    2. Creates all necessary directories.
    3. Installs all necessary requirements. 
    4. Runs the generated scripts for preprocessing and reproduction.

*Important:*
- Do not copy results from the paper.
- All code must be runnable from start to finish.
- Create and maintain a text file named 'output.txt' that documents your thinking during reproduction. Note any assumptions made during reproduction.

*Output Requirements:*
- Save 'output.txt' in the following format in your response:
<file="output.txt"> 
    file contents 
</file>
