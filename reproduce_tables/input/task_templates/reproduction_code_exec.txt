**Reproducibility Task**

*Objective:*
Generate code for reproducing the tables listed below using the methodology in the paper. Use the provided raw data sample to understand the structure of the full raw dataset. *Do not* simply copy paper results.

*Tables to Reproduce:*
{tables_to_reproduce}

*Instructions:*
1. Write a Python script for preprocessing, if necessary, that:
    1. Loads any datasets required for reproduction from the provided data files.
    2. Performs all necessary preprocessing steps (cleaning, formatting, handling missing values, type conversions, etc.).
    3. Generates all required intermediate datasets.
    4. Saves each intermediate dataset as a .csv file.
2. Write all necessary Python scripts for reproducing table results that:
    1. Load the required input data.
    2. Perform all necessary analyses and calculations.
    3. Generate the tables to reproduce, formatted exactly as they appear in the paper.
    4. Save each reproduced table in Markdown format as its own individual Markdown file containing *only* the Markdown table and a notes section as a separate Markdown paragraph below the table, if necessary. *Do not* include any extra text. Name the Markdown file after the table it contains. For example, the file containing {ex_table} should be named '{ex_table}.md'.
    5. Include comments documenting your methodology.
3. Write a bash script that:
    1. Creates a python virtual environment in the current directory.
    2. Creates all necessary directories.
    3. Installs all necessary requirements. 
    4. Runs the generated scripts for preprocessing and reproduction.

*Important:*
- Do not copy results from the paper.
- All code must be runnable from start to finish.
- Note that you do not have access to the full raw dataset. You only have a sample to understand its structure. I provided this so you know how to work with and access features of the full raw dataset. Do not waste time trying to use or understand these values.
- Consider the computational cost of your codes. Do your best to minimize costs and runtimes, but not at the expense of completing your objective.
- Create and maintain a text file named 'output.txt' that documents your thinking during reproduction. Note any assumptions made during reproduction.
- Save and upload all generated files to the Files API so I can access them in your response.

*Capabilities:*
You are capable of writing and executing code, and searching the web. Take advantage of these tools to complete the objective when necessary.
