**Notes:** This table reports estimates of the impact of air pollution monitoring on the probability of being subject to different air-pollution-related enforcement actions by the local government. All regressions control for fixed effects specific to firm, industry-by-time, and province-by-time interactions. Robust standard errors clustered on the city in parentheses. Panel B reports heterogeneity for firms identified as high polluters. The outcome "low intensity" ("high intensity") corresponds to a dummy variable indicating that a firm received only one (at least two) enforcement actions in a quarter. The outcome "lenient" is a dummy variable that equals one if only one punishment (among "suspension," "upgrading," and "fine") is issued against a firm in a quarter. In contrast, the dummy variable "strict" is defined as one if all three types of punishments are issued against a firm in a quarter.
