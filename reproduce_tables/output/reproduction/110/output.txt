REPRODUCTION LOG FOR TABLE 1
=============================

Table 1: Firm Level: Pollution Monitoring and Enforcement Activities

This table shows the impact of having a monitor within 10km on various enforcement outcomes at the firm level.

METHODOLOGY FROM PAPER:
- Uses firm-level data (firm_enf.dta)
- Difference-in-differences specification comparing firms within 10km of a monitor vs farther away
- Equation (2): y_ijpt = δ_i + θ_jt + η_pt + β*m_it^10km + ε_ijpt
- Fixed effects: firm, industry-by-time, province-by-time
- Standard errors clustered at city level
- Sample: firms within 50km of a monitor, operating before 2010
- Period: 2010-2017 (quarterly data)

PANEL A: Any enforcement action related to air pollution
- Outcomes: Any Air, Suspension, Upgrading, Fine, Warning
- Treatment: Mon<10km × Post (monitor within 10km after 2015)

PANEL B: Intensity and strictness of enforcement
- Examines heterogeneous effects by high polluter status
- Outcomes: # Air (count), Low intensity, High intensity, Lenient, Strict
- Includes interaction: Mon<10km × Post × H. Polluter

DATA REQUIREMENTS:
- firm_enf.dta: Main firm-level enforcement panel data
- Contains quarterly observations from 2010-2017
- Key variables:
  * min_dist_10: indicator for firm within 10km of monitor
  * post1: indicator for post-2015 period
  * any_air: indicator for any air pollution enforcement
  * any_air_shutdown, any_air_renovate, any_air_fine, any_air_warning: specific actions
  * air: count of enforcement actions
  * leni, stri: lenient/strict enforcement indicators
  * key: indicator for high polluter (from ESR database)
  * id: firm identifier
  * industry: 4-digit industry code
  * prov_id: province identifier
  * year, quarter: time identifiers
  * city_id: city identifier for clustering

IMPLEMENTATION STEPS:
1. Load firm_enf.dta
2. Create time indicators (year-quarter combinations)
3. Generate interaction terms: min_dist_10 × post1
4. For Panel B: create interaction with high polluter (key variable)
5. Run regressions with appropriate fixed effects and clustered standard errors
6. Format results to match paper table

ASSUMPTIONS:
- The 'key' variable in firm_enf.dta indicates high polluter status (ESR firms)
- min_dist_10 is the treatment variable (within 10km)
- post1 indicates post-2015 period
- leni = 1 if only one type of punishment
- stri = 1 if all three main punishment types issued
- air_1 and air_2 likely represent low/high intensity
- Industry-by-time FE: industry × year × quarter
- Province-by-time FE: prov_id × year × quarter

NOTES ON DATA STRUCTURE:
- Data is already in long format (firm-quarter panel)
- Time period: 2010 Q1 to 2017 Q4
- Sample restricted to firms within 50km and operating before 2010
- Multiple observations per firm across quarters
