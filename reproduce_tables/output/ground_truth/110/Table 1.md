*Notes:* This table reports estimates of the impact of air pollution monitoring on the probability of being subject to different air-pollution-related enforcement actions by the local government. All regressions control for fixed effects specific to firm, industry-by-time, and province-by-time interactions. Robust standard errors clustered on the city in parentheses. In panel A, standard errors based on the spatial HAC technique suggested by Conley (1999) are reported in brackets, using a Bartlett kernel and bandwidth of 100 km. Panel B reports heterogeneity for firms identified as high polluters according to ESR during the pre-period. The outcome "low intensity" ("high intensity") corresponds to a dummy variable indicating that a firm received only one (at least two) enforcement actions in a quarter. The outcome "lenient" is a dummy variable that equals one if only one punishment (among "suspension," "upgrading," and "fine") is issued against a firm in a quarter. In contrast, the dummy variable "strict" is defined as one if all three types of punishments are issued against a firm in a quarter.
