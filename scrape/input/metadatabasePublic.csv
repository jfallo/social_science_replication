Do Transitional Justice Museums Persuade Visitors? Evidence from a Field Experiment,First,21,1,No,0,"Our reproduction of the main findings was largely successful, though we did encounter one coding error on one line of code. When attempting to reproduce Figure 2: Transitional Justice Treatment Effects, the line of the R code “for (i in 22:34){results.df.tj$Variable[i] <- ""pardoned""}” produced an error. The error stated, “replacement has 25 rows, data has 24.” However, the remaining code for that figure ran without any problems and created Figure 2.  Aside from the one error, the code replicated the graphs perfectly. There were no differences between the replicated graphs and the graphs shown in the original article."

Public Infrastructure and Economic Development: Evidence from Postal Systems,First,69,1,Yes,,"Of note, RGMC state for this robustness test that “We re-estimated our benchmark models focusing only on counties in states in which no county borders underwent changes between 1896 and 2000, which includes 13 states” (Rogowski et al. 2022, p12 f.). Our understanding of this sentence is that they re-run the analysis including only states where no county border has changed. Yet, from their code it seems they include states in which at least one county has a stable border over time. This analysis has obviously very different implications. We therefore follow the description in the paper and include only states with stable borders for all counties, which applies to seven states in the data"
Re-Assessing Elite-Public Gaps in Political Behavior,First,70,1,Yes,0,"Computationally reproduced by Odum Institute for Research in Social Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Note by Replicators: Kertzer differs from other replications for two reasons. First, it is a meta-analysis, and so all the meta estimates are precisely estimated and statistically significant. Therefore the magnitude and the percent significant are the quantities of interest. Second, the main claim in Kertzer was a small meta-effect size and a low percent significant, so finding a larger effect size and higher percent significant would be consistent with a failure to replicate."

Social Class and (Un)Ethical Behaviour: Causal and Correlational Evidence,First,76,1,No,1,"Major coding error: In reproducing the summary tables, some minor differences that are believed to be attributable to rounding errors, some examples of mislabeling and some changes in coefficients. Nevertheless, the results stay qualitatively the same and the error appears to be unintentional. A larger issue appeared with colums 2 and 4 of the replication of Table 5 and Table 8 in the paper (here Table 3 and Table 5 respectively). This is due to the way the authors do not differentiate between continuous and categorical variables in their regressions. Specifically, they treat categorical variables as continuous variables (see Section 4 for details). However, this changes the coefficients of all coefficients in these estimation models. Some of the coefficients even change (in some cases decrease) their level of significance. Nevertheless, the results stay qualitatively the same and the error appears to be unintentional."

The Curious Case of Theresa May and the Public That Did Not Rally: Gendered Reactions to Terrorist Attacks Can Cause Slumps Not Bumps,First,86,0,No,1,"Multiple coding errors: First, the dependent variable in column (2) of HMZ’s Table 2 is coded as one (preferring May as best PM) for observations in which participants did not select May: 35,060 of the 97,155 observations come from survey Waves 7 and 8 in which the survey question referred to then-Prime Minister David Cameron. Second, HMZ state that regression to be a logistic regression – however, the implemented Stata command is xtreg, which conducts generalized least squares regressions on panel datasets. We correct both errors, first independently and then jointly, before re-estimating the affected regression. Results remain statistically robust (p < 0.001 in all cases), i.e., our robustness exercises confirm that May’s approval ratings indeed suffered a slump after the Manchester attack. Full results are referred to Table B1. Also other coding errors in election quarter variables: For example, no elections had been coded for the US, while Japanese elections were only coded for one house of the National Diet (Japan’s bicameral parliament). In addition, run-off elections and multiple-round elections that spanned several quarters were sometimes coded for only one quarter, although HMZ’s coding does not systematically always capture the first or second election. Finally, we identified coding inaccuracies that did not seem to follow a systematic pattern with Austria 2016q4, Ecuador 1997q4, Iceland 2008q2 and 2012q2, Mexico 1991q3, Paraguay 2000q3, and Turkey 2014q3.  Beyond the coding errors pertaining to election quarters, we identified three sampling errors that turned out to be inconsequential to our conclusions. First, the woman executive variable had 376 missing observations. We reconstruct that variable from publicly available data and further identify coding errors in observations that did not have missing values. Due to the use of time period t + 1 in the approval variable, and to stay as consistent with HMZ as possible, we define the variable by any quarter in which a woman held the office of head of government or state for at least 15 days in the corresponding quarter. In total, we adjust 612 observations. Second, HMZ’s database features duplicate observations for Macedonia from 2006q2 to 2016q2. Third, HMZ access the GTD for data on international terrorist attacks throughout their sample period. However, the GTD does not feature any data for 1993, as that information was lost in an office move (LaFree and Dugan, 2007; START, 2022). HMZ mechanically code all terrorist attack observations in 1993 with a zero."
