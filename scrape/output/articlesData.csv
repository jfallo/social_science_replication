Our understanding of this sentence is that they re-run the analysis including only states where no county border has changed. Yet, from their code it seems they include states in which at least one county has a stable border over time. This analysis has obviously very different implications. We therefore follow the description in the paper and include only states with stable borders for all counties, which applies to seven states in the data"

Second, HMZ state that regression to be a logistic regression – however, the implemented Stata command is xtreg, which conducts generalized least squares regressions on panel datasets. We correct both errors, first independently and then jointly, before re-estimating the affected regression. Results remain statistically robust (p < 0.001 in all cases), i.e., our robustness exercises confirm that May’s approval ratings indeed suffered a slump after the Manchester attack. Full results are referred to Table B1. Also other coding errors in election quarter variables: For example, no elections had been coded for the US, while Japanese elections were only coded for one house of the National Diet (Japan’s bicameral parliament). In addition, run-off elections and multiple-round elections that spanned several quarters were sometimes coded for only one quarter, although HMZ’s coding does not systematically always capture the first or second election. Finally, we identified coding inaccuracies that did not seem to follow a systematic pattern with Austria 2016q4, Ecuador 1997q4, Iceland 2008q2 and 2012q2, Mexico 1991q3, Paraguay 2000q3, and Turkey 2014q3.  Beyond the coding errors pertaining to election quarters, we identified three sampling errors that turned out to be inconsequential to our conclusions. First, the woman executive variable had 376 missing observations. We reconstruct that variable from publicly available data and further identify coding errors in observations that did not have missing values. Due to the use of time period t + 1 in the approval variable, and to stay as consistent with HMZ as possible, we define the variable by any quarter in which a woman held the office of head of government or state for at least 15 days in the corresponding quarter. In total, we adjust 612 observations. Second, HMZ’s database features duplicate observations for Macedonia from 2006q2 to 2016q2. Third, HMZ access the GTD for data on international terrorist attacks throughout their sample period. However, the GTD does not feature any data for 1993, as that information was lost in an office move (LaFree and Dugan, 2007; START, 2022). HMZ mechanically code all terrorist attack observations in 1993 with a zero."
